Hey! 👋🏾

I'm Kelvin, an aspiring developer from South Carolina.

I love to implement creative thoughts that come to mind into code and learn new concepts along the way.

When I'm not coding, I love to spend my time playing video games, listening to music, spending quality time with my family and adventuring.
