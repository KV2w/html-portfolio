    <h1>Kelvin Keller Jr Developer</h1>
            <p> Hey! 👋🏾 <br> </p> 
            <p>I'm Kelvin, an aspiring developer from South Carolina.<br></p>
            <p>I love to implement creative thoughts that come to mind into code and learn new concepts along the way.<br> </p> 
            <p>When I'm not coding, I love to spend my time playing video games, listening to music, spending quality time with my family and adventuring.<br></p>
            <p>Feel free to get comfy and take a look around.</p>
